Go to Application.java. Create a new @Bean method that instantiates and returns a new RestTemplate. The @Bean method should also be annotated with @LoadBalanced - this will associate the RestTemplate with Ribbon. Code should look something like this:

  //  This "LoadBalanced" RestTemplate 
  //  is automatically hooked into Ribbon:
  @Bean @LoadBalanced
  RestTemplate restTemplate() {
      return new RestTemplate();
  }  
  
  
  @LoadBalanced -- used for client side loadbalancing.
